Week 2 Assignment - Web Page Using R Markdown and Leaflet

## Description
The web page produced from the R Markdown file in this repository shows the 20 oldest colleges and universities in the United States according to the following article found on niche.com:

I found the icon images on Wikimedia Commons:

For some of these schools, I could find the official logo / seal.  For others, I had to use some other image.  Note that the University of Delaware icon is hard to see on the map because it hides behind Newark or Philadelphia, depending on your zoom level.  The College of Charleston icon is also hard to see.
